## Introduction

This project implements a tool that gives the user the opportunity to create a sample week activity table to organize a group.

It gives us	the	possibility	to choose the structure	of a sample	week:
- First	day	of the	week
- Number of	days
- Number of	periods	in a day (1	to 3 corresponding to morning, afternoon and evening)
- First	period of the day (if there	isnâ€™t a	morning	period you can start with afternoon	for	example)

Then you can edit the content of a week: Implementation in progress!!

- Click	on a period	to add a text.
- Drag and drop	the	text to another	period
- Extend a period by stretching
- Delete a period
